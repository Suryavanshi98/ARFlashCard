# ARFlashCard
This Prototype project demonstrates the use of Vuforia Engine to track the image and illustrate AR experience to better understand the world around us.
The project aims to read a flash card and show information based on it.
The applications tracked the letter 'A' and overlay it with a hand sign which refers to 'A'. Similarly, the application can track the letter 'B' and overlay it with a video that can provide some information, here to do the POC an overlay video is played. The application can track multiple images at once (it's a functionality of Vuforia).
